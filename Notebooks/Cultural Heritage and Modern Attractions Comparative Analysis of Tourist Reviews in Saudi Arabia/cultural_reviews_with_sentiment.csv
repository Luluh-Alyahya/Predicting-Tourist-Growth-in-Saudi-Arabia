If you're visiting the Mada'in Salih archaeological site in Saudi Arabia, the Tomb of Lihyan son of Kuza is an absolute must-see. Here's why:

Impressive Architecture: This tomb is a stunning example of Nabataean architecture. Carved directly out of a massive sandstone rock, its elaborate facade stands in stark contrast to the surrounding desert landscape.

The 'Lonely Castle': The tomb gets its nickname from its isolated location. This adds a sense of mystery and grandeur that's quite captivating.

Unfinished Beauty:  While incomplete, the rough chisel marks on the lower portion make it even more fascinating. It feels like you're getting a glimpse into an ancient sculptor's workshop.

Nabataean Insight: The tomb's inscription offers a tiny window into the lives and culture of the Nabataean people, a once-mighty civilization that flourished in the region.

Tips:

Best time to visit: Go at sunrise or sunset when the light casts a beautiful glow on the tomb.

Take a guided tour: A guide will provide historical context and explain the intricate details you might miss on your own.
Other sites: Combine your visit with other amazing tombs in Mada'in Salih for a complete experience.

Overall: The Tomb of Lihyan son of Kuza is a unique and striking monument, perfect for both history lovers and those seeking awe-inspiring desert scenery.",4.7,en,POSITIVE

We visited the library floor by floor, what a great collection of books. When we reached the 5th floor, i saw a nice spot to read, sadly we were  aproached by a lady working there, she nicely told us that children are not allowed in that floor, so we just decided to go down and head to the museum. i hope we were informed earlier.

We went to buy tickets to ithra museum and and childrens museum. the ladies in the ticketing do not know the what time the session starts for children's museum, which is a bit odd considering its their job. After we got the tickets, we headed to ithra museum, in the ticket scanning, we were informed that 1 section is not allowed for kids. that information should have been extended to us by the ladies in the ticketing before we purchased ticket, right? i told them at the ticket scanning, I cant leave my son outside a section while we enjoy the artwork, can I now. the response was, his entrance is free, you did not pay for him, kinda rude huh. someone who seems to be their supervisor aproached me and apologized. I wanted to just refund the tickets but i dont want to ruin the experience for my wife and son.

We entered arcade 1, after around 3 minutes, the guy at the ticket scanning came to us. He said, i told you that you cant enter here. My reply was how should i know which arcade im not allowed to enter. there should be someone in the entrance of the arcade to inform guests about this.im clearly irritated at this point.

So we left arcade 1 and walked down to arcade 2. Art is subjective. i was expecting more.

Arcade 3, the concept was nice, it just lacked depth for me. the lighting made it difficult to see the sea creatures and other images projected on the walls. the interactive stuffs that they have are mostly damaged and  not working, probably due to wear and tear or poor maintenance.

Arcade 4, is very simple but informative. i hope they expand this section.

we left the ithra musem and waited in the lobby.

after less than an hour waiting at the lobby, we were finally allowed to enter the kids museum. we were warmly welcomed and a guy informed us about the available activities. the painting session was composed of giving kids paint and paper, with background music playing, i thought it could have been a more entertaining and memorable experience for the kids.

You can see that the staffs tried their best to entertain however many of the interactive items at the first floor are broken, not functioning properly or kind of dirty.

it was already dark when we left the building. Ithra is  clearly made to impress and make you say wow,  sadly the service does not do the same.",,en,
