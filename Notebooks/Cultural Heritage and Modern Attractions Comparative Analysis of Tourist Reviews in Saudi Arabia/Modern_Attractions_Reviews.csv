Worst part the parking area is more than a km away. You have to come out of the parkade area and walk down an extremely busy street to get to place. There’s barely a sidewalk to walk on. And cars don’t stop for pedestrians to cross unless there’s a policeman to shout at them.

We got to the “gate” and the security told us we needed tickets to enter. When we asked where to get it from he told us to walk to the next gate to scan the QR code. This was displayed on a very small stand that we had trouble finding. Paid SR50 per person to enter.

The “gate” area was quite crowded with no proper directions or signage. And the entrance itself was a damaged pathway. If you going to charge people that much at least make the place look good and have people to welcome and guide guests.

The place is simply a group of restaurants set around a park area. Yes the ancient themed decor is lovely to look at. But all the restaurants are over priced. With a few exceptions, the rest of the food menus are not that amazing.

This place would be impossible to visit in summer because there’s no shaded areas or carts to take people around. And the entrance fee is exorbitant for nothing.",4.6,en,2 stars

A lot of effort has been put into creating this place, which makes the experience much more enjoyable. A lot of walking is involved which can be substituted by renting golf carts/electric scooters. To fully enjoy this place you must spend at least 4 hours. This is a detailed review to help you better plan your experience.

1. Tickets MUST be purchased online through the WeBook app. Tickets are priced evenly for children and adults. The weekend entry only ticket cost SAR 59/person while the weekday entry ticket is priced at SAR 29/person. Tickets including rides/experiences are priced differently and can be seen on the app. The tickets are scanned on your phone at the entry point so keep your phone charged and ready.

2. Parking is accessible from Al Imam Saud Bin Faisal street. The parking is very well staffed and there are plenty of ushers to guide you. There is no entry ticket, and a flat fee of SAR 10/vehicle is charged at exit point.

3. The place is designed on a circular path. From the entrance you can make a left and start at the globe and walk through Egypt pavilion onwards and complete the circle, or you can take a right and start from Indian pavilion and walk through the entire boulevard world. The paths are clearly marked.

4. A full circle of the exhibition will cover a distance of a little over 2 miles/3.5 KM and take almost 3 hours including time for rest and snacks, but not including any rides/exhibitions. Ideally start around 6 PM when the weather is pleasant, however the place got extremely crowded after sunset.

5. For those who would not like to walk, there is a facility at the entrance gate from where you can rent a Golf Cart for family, Electric Scooter for 2 adults max, as well as Strollers/push chairs for children.

6. Each country pavilion includes models of their famous sites, local cuisine restaurants/snack shops, and a full market place for local/traditional items. The prices are slightly higher which is normal for an exhibition like this. Each pavilion also has a local cultural exhibition including traditional music and dance performances that are free. These performances also start around 6:30 PM and continue at regular intervals.

7. ⁠There are a lot of rides/experiences apart from the country pavilions. These include the Dolphin Show, Arcade Gaming Arena, Combat Zone, Amazon Experience, and a Theme Park. It is recommended to look at the reviews of these experiences before buying tickets.

8. The Cable Car ride does not offer value for money. You spend 14 minutes in the cable car, out of which 12 minutes are over a parking lot. The view is not the best either, while they do not let you exit at the Boulevard City. Not great value for money/time or an enjoyable experience.

9. Staff at the Boulevard world as well as at the country pavilions are very helpful and well mannered. This makes the experience much better.

10. Power banks are available for rent across the entire arena through automated machines. Also all vendors accept payments through cards/machines.",4.6,en,Error

The overall experience was enjoyable, but I couldn't help but notice that the prices at the restaurants and games were quite high.

Firstly, the ambiance of Boulevard City is fantastic. The lively atmosphere, with music and lights, creates a vibrant and energetic setting. The park is well-maintained, and the staff members were friendly and helpful throughout my visit.

However, when it came to dining at the restaurants within Boulevard City, I found the prices to be on the higher side. While the food quality was decent, it felt overpriced compared to similar establishments outside the park. This made it difficult to fully enjoy the dining experience without feeling a bit of a pinch on my wallet.

Additionally, the prices for the games and attractions also seemed to be quite steep. While I understand that maintaining and operating these facilities come with costs, it would have been more enjoyable if the prices were more reasonable and affordable for families and individuals.

Despite the higher prices, Boulevard City does offer a wide range of entertainment options. The variety of games, rides, and activities cater to different age groups and interests. The park is well-designed, and there are ample opportunities for fun and excitement.

In summary, Boulevard City is an entertaining and well-maintained park with a lively atmosphere.

The experience of attending the Usyk vs. Fury live press conference and face-off at Riyadh Boulevard was nothing short of exhilarating. It was an event that combined the raw energy of two heavyweight champions with the vibrant and modern backdrop of Riyadh’s premier entertainment district. As a boxing enthusiast, being part of this event was a unique opportunity to witness the drama and spectacle that precedes one of the most anticipated fights in recent history.

#### Setting the Scene

Riyadh Boulevard, known for its cutting-edge architecture and bustling atmosphere, provided the perfect stage for this high-stakes encounter. The area was transformed into a veritable boxing hub, adorned with larger-than-life banners, high-definition screens playing highlights of past fights, and stalls selling merchandise. The venue thrummed with a palpable sense of anticipation as fans from all corners of the globe converged to witness the clash of two titans.

#### The Atmosphere

Upon arrival, the buzz in the air was infectious. Conversations filled the space as fans debated who would come out on top—Usyk, the disciplined and technically brilliant Ukrainian, or Fury, the flamboyant and unpredictable British giant. The crowd’s diversity was a testament to the global appeal of boxing, bringing together people of different cultures and backgrounds, united by their love for the sport.

#### The Press Conference

As the press conference began, the room was a cacophony of camera shutters and excited murmurs. Both fighters made their grand entrances, greeted by thunderous applause. Tyson Fury, with his towering presence and larger-than-life persona, immediately took command of the stage. His humorous jabs and confident declarations were met with cheers and laughter from the audience. In contrast, Oleksandr Usyk’s calm and composed demeanor provided a striking counterpoint. His responses were measured and focused, underscoring his reputation as a disciplined tactician.

The verbal sparring between the two was a highlight of the event. Fury’s bravado and Usyk’s quiet confidence created a dynamic that kept the audience riveted. Questions from the media ranged from training regimens to personal motivations, providing insights into the mindsets of both fighters. The tension and mutual respect were evident, setting the stage for the intense face-off that followed.

#### The Face-Off

The face-off was the pinnacle of the event. The atmosphere became electric as the two fighters approached each other. The crowd fell silent, the weight of the moment sinking in. Standing toe-to-toe, Fury’s height and imposing presence contrasted with Usyk’s solid, unyielding stance. Their eyes locked in a psychological battle, each trying to assert dominance without uttering a word. The intensity of the stare-down was a powerful reminder of the physical and mental demands of boxing.

#### Fan Interaction and Community

One of the most enjoyable aspects of the event was the interaction among fans. The shared excitement created a sense of community, with strangers exchanging predictions and stories. Merchandise stalls did brisk business, selling everything from t-shirts and caps to autographed gloves and posters. For many, these items would serve as lasting mementos of an unforgettable experience.

Some fans were fortunate enough to secure autographs and photos with the fighters, adding a personal touch to the event. These moments of connection between fans and their idols highlighted the accessibility and human side of the sport, often overshadowed by the glamour and intensity of the competition.

#### Conclusion

Watching the Usyk vs. Fury live press conference and face-off at Riyadh Boulevard was an unforgettable experience, blending the thrill of boxing with the cultural richness of Riyadh. It was a day filled with excitement, camaraderie, and anticipation, offering a glimpse into the world of professional boxing and the personalities that define it. The event no",4.6,en,Error

People are able now to have fun in a mixed-gender setting. No one will interrogate or confront you because you are with a male friend or companion.

The location is strategically placed and can be easily reached. It's like a few minutes away from the city center.

Winter Wonderland has an entrance fee of 55 SAR per head during weekdays and 110 SAR per head on weekends.

The Parking lot has a fee as well; it’s 10 SAR per hour (OMG, Riyadh is becoming an expensive city).

I hope they make the parking free of charge for their guests because there’s already an entrance fee. Just my two-cents‼️

People, you need to book online first before going there as you need to pay online. There is no cashier for the entrance fee. Also, prepare your Tawakkalna.

The lady guards will check your bag upon entering. One of the lady guards took some of my gum in my bag hahaha

The atmosphere inside is so relaxed, especially during this winter season. Yes, girl, we have winter here in Saudi Arabia, Riyadh. The lights were so good, the decorations and displays are so instagramable

There are booths where you can buy tickets for Games and rides. Games range from 10 to 50 SAR. You can buy a 50 SAR ticket or more. You can play some of the games and go on rides you like. The ticket is a wristband with a QR code.

There are a lot of food kiosks you'll not get worried about getting hungry. One of our favorites is the shawarma stall, affordable but so yummy.

Beware of the games you choose. Some of them are rigged

The stuffed toy prizes are of good quality Kids and adults young at heart will surely enjoy it there.

Overall, winter wonderland is a great experience for first-timers, but it’s something you only need to experience once. The novelty of it wears off quickly.

- There are many restaurants and cafes to suit all tastes.

- There are toilets and chapel for men and women.

Therefore, I did not want to visit the place at first in order to avoid any potential problems that usually accompany the opening of new sites. I visited the place yesterday, it is very beautiful, but I will limit my comment here to the negatives:

1- reaching the place and the parking area is a real nightmare, the signs are not clear and insufficient, and the traffic control is backward. It gives you a very bad feeling before entering the place, so I recommend going by taxi and avoid going there by your car unless you are planning to pay 500 SAR for the VIP parking.

2- The stores in each zone do not represent the theme of mini-countries, so expect to find in the China Zone, Egypt, Japan and France the spice and incense shops that you find in the Taiba Market, Al Owais and other popular markets in Riyadh, and to find Iranian products in the Chinese Zone and to find Omani products in the Morocco Zone and to find Syrian products in Zone Egypt, so you never feel that each zone is distinguished from others except by the built structures

3- The directional signs there are insufficient and not clear. Therefore, you find people crowded and many of them lost and asking where to go and how to find some of the zones that they could not reach. Therefore, the entire signage system outside and inside the Boulevard needs another look and rapid and comprehensive development.

4-I am surprised that there is no zone representing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, its products, civilization and culture. The tourist will see a replica of the Global Village in Dubai without feeling that he is in Saudi Arabia, as there is nothing that indicates the greatness and history of Saudi Arabia, the diversity of its products and the differences in cultures around its regions. If I were responsible, I would have placed a zone for each of the regions in the kingdom so that the tourist comes away with a treasure of knowledge that cannot be found in Dubai, Istanbul or elsewhere.",4.6,en,2 stars

Specially I need to mention the hosts, the security, workers and all the staff are very very nice polite and well trained.

1. Ferris Wheel for Families with Kids to have an aerial view of the wonderland
2. Pirate Ship for the 1st adrenaline rush to start
3. Roller coaster, slingshot, and Appolo 15 for the crazy ones

- France was nice, loved how spot on the Eiffel tower was and the cafes there were good. It’s super small though and if you go during a weekend or holiday it will be too hard to get around.
- UK was practically empty, there was almost nothing there besides the ferries wheel and fish and chips which I do not recommend.
- US was so stereotypical so I was not disappointed, if you’re a picky eater you will have familiar places there to eat.
- Asia was literally just Thailand… but the food was nice!
- India was fun! Loved the food although not so authentic and I liked the bazaar area as well as the indian shows.
- Egypt was my favorite, the pyramids were nice to see and the vibe there is quite nice. You feel like you’re really in a different world.
- Greece was basically just Mykonos but I loved the show.
- Italy was okay but it had Dominos pizza and that’s so criminal, it should be in the US. Enjoyed the haunted hotel though.
- Morocco was nice too but mostly in the lounges area. Bazaar was so annoying and sellers are so clingy they will literally never take no for an answer even when you tell them that you don’t want to buy so I literally sprinted outta there.
- Levantine was just a bazaar, they had a show but I couldn’t even see because of the crowd and since I’m a short queen the taller crowd blocked my view so I just recorded the show while raising my phone and that’s how I watched it lol, AND it was placed in such a small area. Plus, I don’t understand why Iranian products were selling there… the vibe was just not right tbh…
- China was super nice! Really big and same with Egypt you really feel like you’re in a different world so I loved it! Boba shop was not too nice though and it’s not even Chinese but ok…

Prices of entrance are cheap during the weekdays and weekends, however, black market sellers are so annoying because they will literally buy all the tickets and sell them to you for more than double the price, so if you know you’re going beforehand, check the website the week before to buy tickets. Slots are opened weekly I believe every Saturday or Sunday.

Prices of food there are okay i guess, in Asia, Greece and China they were a bit too expensive though. But I was expecting these prices from this place anyway. So if you take my approach and try little things from every zone, expect to spend 200SAR to 300SAR on just food.

Overall, it is not really authentic representation of the countries and cultures but I liked the idea and I believe it will be heading to a better directions with the next seasons. DO NOT go there on a holiday or weekends because you will most likely hate it. And expect to spend the whole day there:)  I really recommend going if you would like to experience something different in Riyadh.",4.6,en,Error

Riyadh Boulevard City is undeniably a fantastic place with numerous attractions and a vibrant atmosphere. The city offers a wide range of entertainment options, making it a great destination for families and individuals alike. However, it is worth noting that Riyadh Boulevard City can be quite expensive.

One of the highlights of Riyadh Boulevard City is its lively atmosphere. The city is bustling with activity, and there is always something happening. Whether it's live performances, cultural events, or recreational activities, there is never a dull moment in this vibrant city.

Families can enjoy quality time together, and individuals can explore their interests and hobbies. The city offers a diverse range of activities that cater to different age groups and interests.

However, one drawback of Riyadh Boulevard City is its cost. The city's many attractions, restaurants, and shopping centers can be quite expensive, which may limit some people's ability to fully enjoy all that it has to offer. It's important to consider your budget and plan accordingly to avoid overspending.

Despite the expense, Riyadh Boulevard City remains an exciting and enjoyable destination. It offers a unique experience that combines entertainment, culture, and leisure. If you're willing to splurge and embrace the vibrant atmosphere, you'll undoubtedly have a memorable time in this bustling city.
